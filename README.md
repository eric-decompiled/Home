Audio-Visual Explorations

**[decompiled.dev](https://decompiled.dev)**

A collection of interactive web apps exploring sound synthesis, music visualization, and signal processing. Built with Vite and Astro.

## Apps

- **Fractured Jukebox** - MIDI-driven music visualizer with fractals
- **Lissajous** - Lissajous curves and musical intervals
- **Resonator** - RLC resonator for audio synthesis
- **Sound Synth** - Interactive harmonics explorer
- **Karplus-Strong** - Plucked string synthesis
- **Intervals** - Ear training with adaptive difficulty

## Development

Each app in `apps/` is standalone and can be developed individually:

```bash
cd apps/fractured-jukebox
npm install
npm run dev
```

This provides hot reload for fast iteration.

To run the full site:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
